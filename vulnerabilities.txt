VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		10.29.254.16	2019.Feb.22 	2019.Feb.22 00:09 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)
QID Detection Logic(authenticated):

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.206.247	2019.Feb.21 	2019.Feb.21 17:25 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
This unauthenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of Dropbear SSH based on the banner disclosed by the remote service.	Customers are advised to upgrade to <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dropbear SSH 2016.74</a> or later versions to remediate these vulnerabilities.

Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):

Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		172.25.195.77	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 16:38 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		172.25.195.71	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 16:14 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.

2240 	22 	172.21.67.208	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 13:16 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

2240 		172.21.60.230	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 10:50 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Null Authentication VNC Server Access 
2240 	5901 	172.21.67.44	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 12:03 	S1 (Urgent) 	VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is similar to Xwindows in that it is a remote, graphical interface. It is freely available from multiple vendors (for example AT&T Cambridge).
To create a session with VNC server, a primitive sort of authentication is implemented. There is an option to not use authentication at all, in which case anyone is allowed to connect to the VNC server.
An example of such default configuration is ClumpOS.
ClumpOS is a CD-based Linux and Mosix distribution that is maintained and distributed by the Mosix project. ClumpOS does not prompt a user to set a password for VNC when installed. Instead, ClumpOS leaves the default password for VNC blank, which allows remote root access to the system.	As a possible workaround, manually set a VNC password or remove the VNC server (if not needed).	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.209.188	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 15:11 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted (CVE-2012-0002).
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol service processes packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target service to stop responding (CVE-2012-0152).
This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
Note:
NLA or network layer authentication is a layer of security on top of RDP. If NLA is enabled then the vulnerability can be exploited remotely but will need credentials.
1. The authenticated check will determine presence of this vulnerability irrespective of the NLA setting.
2. The remote check can determine presence of this vulnerability only if NLA is disabled.
We encourage customers to patch irrespective of the NLA status.

2240 	22 	172.21.67.200	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 12:43 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		172.21.67.160	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 10:24 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)
QID Detection Logic(authenticated):
This QID checks for vulnerable versions of VMware ESXi 5.5	To resolve this issue, upgrade to VMware ESXi Build 6480267or the latest VMware ESXi build.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted (CVE-2012-0002).
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol service processes packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target service to stop responding (CVE-2012-0152).
This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
Note:
NLA or network layer authentication is a layer of security on top of RDP. If NLA is enabled then the vulnerability can be exploited remotely but will need credentials.
1. The authenticated check will determine presence of this vulnerability irrespective of the NLA setting.
2. The remote check can determine presence of this vulnerability only if NLA is disabled.
We encourage customers to patch irrespective of the NLA status.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		172.21.208.228	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 14:51 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

VMware ESX 4.0 Third Party Updates for Service Console (VMSA-2010-0013) 
2240 		172.21.60.177	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 12:52 	S2 (High) 	Vmware ESX 4.0 released updates for Service Console to resolve the following vulnerabilities:
Buffer overflow in cpio 2.6-8.FC4 on 64-bit platforms, when creating a cpio archive, allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file whose size is represented by more than 8 digits. 
Heap-based buffer overflow in the rmt_read__ function in lib/rtapelib.c in the rmt client functionality in GNU tar before 1.23 and GNU cpio before 2.11 allows remote rmt servers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code by sending more data than was requested, related to archive filenames that contain a : (colon) character. 
Buffer overflow in the SMB1 packet chaining implementation in the chain_reply function in process.c in smbd in Samba 3.0.x before 3.3.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted field in a packet. 
The kg_accept_krb5 function in krb5/accept_sec_context.c in the GSS-API library in MIT Kerberos 5 through 1.7.1 and 1.8 before 1.8.2, as used in kadmind and other applications, does not properly check for invalid GSS-API tokens, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an AP-REQ message in which the authenticator's checksum field is missing. 
The Safe module before 2.25 for Perl allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended Safe::reval and Safe::rdo access restrictions, and inject and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving implicitly called methods and implicitly blessed objects, as demonstrated by the DESTROY and AUTOLOAD methods, related to "automagic methods." 
The Safe module 2.26, and certain earlier versions, for Perl, as used in PostgreSQL 7.4 before 7.4.29, 8.0 before 8.0.25, 8.1 before 8.1.21, 8.2 before 8.2.17, 8.3 before 8.3.11, 8.4 before 8.4.4, and 9.0 Beta before 9.0 Beta 2, allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended Safe::reval and Safe::rdo access restrictions, and inject and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving subroutine references and delayed execution.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		172.21.67.161	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 12:12 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Null Authentication VNC Server Access 
2240 	5901 	172.21.67.48	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 11:52 	S1 (Urgent) 	VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is similar to Xwindows in that it is a remote, graphical interface. It is freely available from multiple vendors (for example AT&T Cambridge).
To create a session with VNC server, a primitive sort of authentication is implemented. There is an option to not use authentication at all, in which case anyone is allowed to connect to the VNC server.
An example of such default configuration is ClumpOS.
ClumpOS is a CD-based Linux and Mosix distribution that is maintained and distributed by the Mosix project. ClumpOS does not prompt a user to set a password for VNC when installed. Instead, ClumpOS leaves the default password for VNC blank, which allows remote root access to the system.	As a possible workaround, manually set a VNC password or remove the VNC server (if not needed).	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

2240 		172.21.60.231	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 10:20 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		172.21.208.227	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 14:01 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.209.141	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 15:25 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.208.162	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 14:10 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
This unauthenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of Dropbear SSH based on the banner disclosed by the remote service.

Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (MS12-020) 
2240 		172.21.50.90	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Feb.21 12:19 	S1 (Urgent) 	The Remote Desktop feature in Windows enables access to all of the programs, resources and accessories on a user's computer from a second Windows-based computer.
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted (CVE-2012-0002).
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol service processes packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target service to stop responding (CVE-2012-0152).
This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
Note:
NLA or network layer authentication is a layer of security on top of RDP. If NLA is enabled then the vulnerability can be exploited remotely but will need credentials.
1. The authenticated check will determine presence of this vulnerability irrespective of the NLA setting.
2. The remote check can determine presence of this vulnerability only if NLA is disabled.
We encourage customers to patch irrespective of the NLA status.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		172.25.195.130	2019.Feb.09 	2019.Feb.21 15:37 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

2240 	22 	10.29.254.6	2019.Feb.08 	2019.Feb.22 00:21 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):

A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts.

CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.204.203	2019.Feb.08 	2019.Feb.21 21:58 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.

Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart parser Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (S2-045) 
2240 	443 	172.21.56.84	2019.Feb.03 	2019.Feb.21 13:12 	S1 (Urgent) 	Apache Struts is a framework for building web applications. A vulnerability exists due to improper handling of requests with a malicious Content-Type value. If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user.
Affected software:
Apache Struts 2.3.5 to 2.3.31
Apache Struts 2.5 to 2.5.10
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
The QID has two type of signatures. In the first type the scanner send a custom Content-Type header to check for command execution to the .action, .go,.do and other common files. In the second type the scanner asks the target to perform an arithmetic operation via the Content-Type header to check for command execution. Since this is an active check the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration for the check to work.
Please note:
1) If there is an authentication scheme configured for the server, then VM scanner will not be able to detect this QID. In such cases we recommend using the WAS QID 150173 as WAS has support for authentication as well as in-dept crawling. Please refer to the Qualys Apache Struts blog:
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution</a>
2) The requests sent by the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration. If the vulnerable behavior is triggered in a nested directory which the scanner cannot find then this QID will not be posted.
QID detection logic (Authenticated):
Detection looks for "struts core" jar files in deployed web applications directories and lib folder of Tomcat server. Once it successfully finds the jar file, version information is extracted from that jar files and compared.
Please note: Our detection does not support if the applications are deployed with server configuration unpackWARs=false.	The vendor has released advisories and updates to fix these vulnerabilities. Refer to the following link for further details:

Null Session/Password NetBIOS Access 
1367 		10.22.175.134	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 18:22 	S1 (Urgent) 	Unauthorized users can connect to this NetBIOS service without a password.	Null NetBIOS sessions can be disabled using the following methods:
Windows NT: 
1. Set the following registry key: 
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
Name: RestrictAnonymous
Type: REG_DWORD Value: 1
2. Restart your computer.
Windows 2000:
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure "Additional restrictions of anonymous connections" is set to
"No access without explicit anonymous permissions". 
4. Restart your computer.
Windows XP/2003: 
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure the following two policies are enabled:
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts 
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares
4. Disable Network Access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users.
5. Restart your computer. 
The above settings have no impact on domain controllers. If this vulnerability was discovered on a domain controller, please note that some of the recommended settings may not have any effect. Read the Microsoft article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257988/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Description of Dcpromo Permissions Choices</a> for more information regarding Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access. Please read the Microsoft documents called <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;246261" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">How to Use the RestrictAnonymous Registry Value</a> for more information.
Samba: 
Make the following settings in smb.conf:
•	set "security" to "user" or "domain" or "server" as per your requirements. 
•	set "map_to_guest" to "Never" 
SECURITY = USER
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. With user-level security a client must first "log=on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
SECURITY = SERVER
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to security = user, but note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file to check users against. See the documentation file in the docs/ directory ENCRYPTION.txt for details on how to set this up.
SECURITY = DOMAIN
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to true. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
•	Also add "restrict anonymous = 2" to the "[global]" configuration section.
Note:Setting this parameter in Samba versions prior to 4 may impact Samba's ability to service Windows 9x clients, act as a Domain Controller or serve as the Master Browser.

2240 	22 	10.29.206.133	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 19:56 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

2240 	22 	10.29.212.199	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 22:39 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

2240 	22 	10.29.206.111	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 22:06 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.206.23	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 16:41 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74

2240 	22 	10.29.211.158	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 18:27 	S2 (High) 	SSH1 protocol was deprecated due to multiple vulnerabilities and design flaws.
Among multiple vulnerabilities that exist in SSH protocol Version 1 are:
a CRC32 compensation attack detector vulnerability (buffer overflow)
an unauthorized session key recovery problem
Multiple vendors' implementations are vulnerable due to the fact that these are protocol design errors. Version 2 of the SSH protocol fixed these errors.

IPMI 2.0 RAKP Authentication Remote Password Hash Retrieval Vulnerability 
2240 		10.29.205.200	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 18:47 	S2 (High) 	The IPMI 2.0 specification supports RMCP+ Authenticated Key-Exchange Protocol (RAKP) authentication, which allows remote attackers to obtain password hashes and conduct offline password guessing attacks by obtaining the HMAC from a RAKP message 2 response from a BMC.
Note: The IPMI 2.0 RAKP Authentication will be performed for the following users names: ADMIN, admin, root, Administrator, USERID.	IBM has made available a fix for CVE-2013-4037 at the following location: <a href="http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-5093463" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MIGR-5093463</a>

Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.212.209	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 22:25 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.

Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		10.29.213.195	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 19:44 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.206.9	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 16:48 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Oracle Database TNS Listener Poison Attack Vulnerability 
2240 	1521 	10.29.197.87	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 15:56 	S2 (High) 	A vulnerability exists in the Listener component of Oracle Database Server. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows successful unauthenticated network attacks via Oracle Net. Successful attack of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to all Listener accessible data as well as read access to all Listener accessible data and ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Listener.
This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by registering an additional database instance in the TNS listener. The listener will then start load-balancing traffic to the new instance. This allows the attacker to receive the database transactions, record them and forward them to the original database. The attacker could also potentially modify the transactions and execute commands on the original database server. 
This QID sends a request to register with the listener with the following command:
(CONNECT_DATA=(COMMAND=service_register_NSGR))
If the listener acknowledges and allows the scanner to register, then the QID is posted. If Oracle suggested solution is applied then the listener should not allow the scanner to register successfully.
Affected Products and Versions:
Oracle Database 11g Release 2, versions 11.2.0.2, 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4
Oracle Database 11g Release 1, version 11.1.0.7
Oracle Database 10g Release 2, versions 10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 10.2.0.5
NOTE: Although Oracle Database prior to 10g versions are not listed in the Oracle advisory, older versions of Oracle not covered by their lifetime policy and as per advisory, they could be affected.	There are no vendor supplied patches available at this time, however; Oracle has released workarounds to resolve the issue.
Production Oracle database installations typically do not expose their TNS listener to the Internet or even the enterprise network.
Workaround:
Oracle has released a workaround to resolve this issue. Refer to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alert-cve-2012-1675-1608180.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Oracle CVE-2012-1675 Alert</a> to obtain more information.

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.254.22	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.22 00:27 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74

Apache Tomcat JK Web Server Connector Path Traversal Information Disclosure Vulnerability 
2240 	80 	10.29.194.103	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 22:33 	S2 (High) 	The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector did not handle some edge cases correctly.
If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.
It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd.
It is vulnerable only if jkstatus is present with specific configurations in the server.
Affected Versions:
Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
It sends a GET request to serverIP/jkstatus; to check if target is vulnerable.	The vendor has advised to upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector to version 1.2.46 or later, which is available for download from <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apache Tomcat jk connector</a> Web site.
Workaround:
The vendor has advised to use alternative measures (e.g. the remote address filter) to restrict access to trusted users.

Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.206.114	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 21:59 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Cisco Catalyst 3500 XL Remote Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability 
2240 	80 	10.29.212.62	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 22:30 	S1 (Urgent) 	Cisco Catalyst 3500 XL is a high-speed switch implemented in local area networks. 
A vulnerability exists in the Web server configuration interface allowing anonymous unauthorized users to execute commands. HTTP requests that contain /exec and a known filename will reveal the contents of the file specified. In addition to disclosing the contents of files, this vulnerability could enable unauthorized users to execute arbitrary code.	A possible workaround involves disabling the Web configuration interface. Otherwise, contact CISCO for a patch. For more information, visit

Name: RestrictAnonymous
Type: REG_DWORD Value: 1
2. Restart your computer.
Windows 2000:
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure "Additional restrictions of anonymous connections" is set to
"No access without explicit anonymous permissions". 
4. Restart your computer.
Windows XP/2003: 
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure the following two policies are enabled:
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts 
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares
4. Disable Network Access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users.
5. Restart your computer. 
The above settings have no impact on domain controllers. If this vulnerability was discovered on a domain controller, please note that some of the recommended settings may not have any effect.

Samba: 
Make the following settings in smb.conf:
•	set "security" to "user" or "domain" or "server" as per your requirements. 
•	set "map_to_guest" to "Never" 
SECURITY = USER
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. With user-level security a client must first "log=on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
SECURITY = SERVER
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to security = user, but note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file to check users against. See the documentation file in the docs/ directory ENCRYPTION.txt for details on how to set this up.
SECURITY = DOMAIN
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to true. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
•	Also add "restrict anonymous = 2" to the "[global]" configuration section.
Note:Setting this parameter in Samba versions prior to 4 may impact Samba's ability to service Windows 9x clients, act as a Domain Controller or serve as the Master Browser.

If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

IPMI 2.0 RAKP Authentication Remote Password Hash Retrieval Vulnerability 
2240 		10.29.204.7	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 21:44 	S2 (High) 	The IPMI 2.0 specification supports RMCP+ Authenticated Key-Exchange Protocol (RAKP) authentication, which allows remote attackers to obtain password hashes and conduct offline password guessing attacks by obtaining the HMAC from a RAKP message 2 response from a BMC.
Note: The IPMI 2.0 RAKP Authentication will be performed for the following users names: ADMIN, admin, root, Administrator, USERID.	IBM has made available a fix for CVE-2013-4037 at the following location: <a href="http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-5093463" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MIGR-5093463</a>
Workaround:
Ensure that no IPMI enabled devices are exposed to untrusted networks.

Null Authentication VNC Server Access 
1367 	5900 	10.22.168.64	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 15:42 	S1 (Urgent) 	VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is similar to Xwindows in that it is a remote, graphical interface. It is freely available from multiple vendors (for example AT&T Cambridge).
To create a session with VNC server, a primitive sort of authentication is implemented. There is an option to not use authentication at all, in which case anyone is allowed to connect to the VNC server.
An example of such default configuration is ClumpOS.
ClumpOS is a CD-based Linux and Mosix distribution that is maintained and distributed by the Mosix project. ClumpOS does not prompt a user to set a password for VNC when installed. Instead, ClumpOS leaves the default password for VNC blank, which allows remote root access to the system.	As a possible workaround, manually set a VNC password or remove the VNC server (if not needed).	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

Apache Tomcat JK Web Server Connector Path Traversal Information Disclosure Vulnerability 
2240 	80 	10.29.194.102	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 20:29 	S2 (High) 	The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector did not handle some edge cases correctly.
If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.
It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd.
It is vulnerable only if jkstatus is present with specific configurations in the server.
Affected Versions:
Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
It sends a GET request to serverIP/jkstatus; to check if target is vulnerable.	The vendor has advised to upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector to version 1.2.46 or later, which is available for download from <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apache Tomcat jk connector</a> Web site.
Workaround:
The vendor has advised to use alternative measures (e.g. the remote address filter) to restrict access to trusted users.

Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
This unauthenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of Dropbear SSH based on the banner disclosed by the remote service.

Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart parser Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (S2-045) 
2240 	443 	10.29.193.52	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 21:57 	S1 (Urgent) 	Apache Struts is a framework for building web applications. A vulnerability exists due to improper handling of requests with a malicious Content-Type value. If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user.
Affected software:
Apache Struts 2.3.5 to 2.3.31
Apache Struts 2.5 to 2.5.10
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
The QID has two type of signatures. In the first type the scanner send a custom Content-Type header to check for command execution to the .action, .go,.do and other common files. In the second type the scanner asks the target to perform an arithmetic operation via the Content-Type header to check for command execution. Since this is an active check the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration for the check to work.
Please note:
1) If there is an authentication scheme configured for the server, then VM scanner will not be able to detect this QID. In such cases we recommend using the WAS QID 150173 as WAS has support for authentication as well as in-dept crawling. Please refer to the Qualys Apache Struts blog:
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution</a>
2) The requests sent by the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration. If the vulnerable behavior is triggered in a nested directory which the scanner cannot find then this QID will not be posted.
QID detection logic (Authenticated):
Detection looks for "struts core" jar files in deployed web applications directories and lib folder of Tomcat server. Once it successfully finds the jar file, version information is extracted from that jar files and compared.
Please note: Our detection does not support if the applications are deployed with server configuration unpackWARs=false.	The vendor has released advisories and updates to fix these vulnerabilities. Refer to the following link for further details:

Windows NT: 
1. Set the following registry key: 
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
Name: RestrictAnonymous
Type: REG_DWORD Value: 1
2. Restart your computer.
Windows 2000:
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure "Additional restrictions of anonymous connections" is set to
"No access without explicit anonymous permissions". 
4. Restart your computer.
Windows XP/2003: 
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure the following two policies are enabled:
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts 
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares
4. Disable Network Access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users.
5. Restart your computer. 
The above settings have no impact on domain controllers. If this vulnerability was discovered on a domain controller, please note that some of the recommended settings may not have any effect. Read the Microsoft article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257988/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Description of Dcpromo Permissions Choices</a> for more information regarding Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access.

Samba: 
Make the following settings in smb.conf:
•	set "security" to "user" or "domain" or "server" as per your requirements. 
•	set "map_to_guest" to "Never" 
SECURITY = USER
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. With user-level security a client must first "log=on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
SECURITY = SERVER
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to security = user, but note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file to check users against. See the documentation file in the docs/ directory ENCRYPTION.txt for details on how to set this up.
SECURITY = DOMAIN
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to true. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
•	Also add "restrict anonymous = 2" to the "[global]" configuration section.
Note:Setting this parameter in Samba versions prior to 4 may impact Samba's ability to service Windows 9x clients, act as a Domain Controller or serve as the Master Browser.

Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		10.22.175.85	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 22:11 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)
QID Detection Logic(authenticated):

1367 	80 	10.22.175.115	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 17:55 	S1 (Urgent) 	Cisco Catalyst 3500 XL is a high-speed switch implemented in local area networks. 
A vulnerability exists in the Web server configuration interface allowing anonymous unauthorized users to execute commands. HTTP requests that contain /exec and a known filename will reveal the contents of the file specified. In addition to disclosing the contents of files, this vulnerability could enable unauthorized users to execute arbitrary code.	A possible workaround involves disabling the Web configuration interface. Otherwise, contact CISCO for a patch. For more information, visit

Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		10.29.192.69	2019.Feb.01 	2019.Feb.21 18:45 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

2240 	22 	10.29.207.55	2019.Jan.31 	2019.Feb.21 18:59 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

2240 	22 	10.29.207.4	2019.Jan.31 	2019.Feb.21 20:15 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

1367 	22 	10.22.175.25	2019.Jan.31 	2019.Feb.21 21:00 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

1367 		172.25.195.161	2019.Jan.20 	2019.Feb.21 16:25 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart parser Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (S2-045) 
2240 	443 	10.29.202.43	2019.Jan.18 	2019.Feb.21 18:57 	S1 (Urgent) 	Apache Struts is a framework for building web applications. A vulnerability exists due to improper handling of requests with a malicious Content-Type value. If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user.
Affected software:
Apache Struts 2.3.5 to 2.3.31
Apache Struts 2.5 to 2.5.10
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
The QID has two type of signatures. In the first type the scanner send a custom Content-Type header to check for command execution to the .action, .go,.do and other common files. In the second type the scanner asks the target to perform an arithmetic operation via the Content-Type header to check for command execution. Since this is an active check the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration for the check to work.
Please note:
1) If there is an authentication scheme configured for the server, then VM scanner will not be able to detect this QID. In such cases we recommend using the WAS QID 150173 as WAS has support for authentication as well as in-dept crawling. Please refer to the Qualys Apache Struts blog:
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution</a>
2) The requests sent by the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration. If the vulnerable behavior is triggered in a nested directory which the scanner cannot find then this QID will not be posted.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre)

A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts.

1367 	443 	10.22.50.141	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 00:40 	S2 (High) 	The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector did not handle some edge cases correctly.
If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.
It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd.
It is vulnerable only if jkstatus is present with specific configurations in the server.
Affected Versions:
Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
It sends a GET request to serverIP/jkstatus; to check if target is vulnerable.	The vendor has advised to upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector to version 1.2.46 or later, which is available for download from <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apache Tomcat jk connector</a> Web site.
Workaround:
The vendor has advised to use alternative measures (e.g. the remote address filter) to restrict access to trusted users.

SSH User Login Bruteforced 
1367 	22 	10.22.50.80	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.21 22:54 	S1 (Urgent) 	One or more valid SSH user logins have been found through bruteforcing. 
An account on a router, firewall, or other network device has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0508)
A Unix account has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0502)
Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted (CVE-2012-0002).
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol service processes packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target service to stop responding (CVE-2012-0152).
This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
Note:
NLA or network layer authentication is a layer of security on top of RDP. If NLA is enabled then the vulnerability can be exploited remotely but will need credentials.
1. The authenticated check will determine presence of this vulnerability irrespective of the NLA setting.
2. The remote check can determine presence of this vulnerability only if NLA is disabled.
We encourage customers to patch irrespective of the NLA status.

1367 		10.22.50.45	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.21 20:08 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

1367 		10.22.50.40	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 01:24 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts.

Oracle Database TNS Listener Poison Attack Vulnerability 
1367 	1521 	10.22.50.83	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 02:15 	S2 (High) 	A vulnerability exists in the Listener component of Oracle Database Server. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows successful unauthenticated network attacks via Oracle Net. Successful attack of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to all Listener accessible data as well as read access to all Listener accessible data and ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Listener.
This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by registering an additional database instance in the TNS listener. The listener will then start load-balancing traffic to the new instance. This allows the attacker to receive the database transactions, record them and forward them to the original database. The attacker could also potentially modify the transactions and execute commands on the original database server. 
This QID sends a request to register with the listener with the following command:
(CONNECT_DATA=(COMMAND=service_register_NSGR))
If the listener acknowledges and allows the scanner to register, then the QID is posted. If Oracle suggested solution is applied then the listener should not allow the scanner to register successfully.
Affected Products and Versions:
Oracle Database 11g Release 2, versions 11.2.0.2, 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4
Oracle Database 11g Release 1, version 11.1.0.7
Oracle Database 10g Release 2, versions 10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 10.2.0.5
NOTE: Although Oracle Database prior to 10g versions are not listed in the Oracle advisory, older versions of Oracle not covered by their lifetime policy and as per advisory, they could be affected.	There are no vendor supplied patches available at this time, however; Oracle has released workarounds to resolve the issue.

SSH User Login Bruteforced 
1367 	22 	10.22.50.141	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 00:40 	S1 (Urgent) 	One or more valid SSH user logins have been found through bruteforcing. 
An account on a router, firewall, or other network device has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0508)
A Unix account has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0502)
Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		10.22.50.36	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 09:51 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Apache Tomcat JK Web Server Connector Path Traversal Information Disclosure Vulnerability 
1367 	80 	10.22.50.141	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 00:40 	S2 (High) 	The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map in Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector did not handle some edge cases correctly.
If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.
It was also possible in some configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in httpd.
It is vulnerable only if jkstatus is present with specific configurations in the server.
Affected Versions:
Apache Tomcat JK (mod_jk) Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.44
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
It sends a GET request to serverIP/jkstatus; to check if target is vulnerable.	The vendor has advised to upgrade to Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector to version 1.2.46 or later, which is available for download from <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apache Tomcat jk connector</a> Web site.
Workaround:
The vendor has advised to use alternative measures (e.g. the remote address filter) to restrict access to trusted users.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		10.22.50.33	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.21 16:25 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

A Unix account has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0502)
Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (MS12-020) 
1367 		10.22.49.109	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 05:00 	S1 (Urgent) 	The Remote Desktop feature in Windows enables access to all of the programs, resources and accessories on a user's computer from a second Windows-based computer.
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted (CVE-2012-0002).
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol service processes packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target service to stop responding (CVE-2012-0152).
This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
Note:
NLA or network layer authentication is a layer of security on top of RDP. If NLA is enabled then the vulnerability can be exploited remotely but will need credentials.
1. The authenticated check will determine presence of this vulnerability irrespective of the NLA setting.
2. The remote check can determine presence of this vulnerability only if NLA is disabled.
We encourage customers to patch irrespective of the NLA status.

1367 		10.22.50.32	2019.Jan.17 	2019.Feb.28 08:29 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

An account on a router, firewall, or other network device has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0508)
A Unix account has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0502)
Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters. 
	Contain both upper and lower case letters. 
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9). 
	Contain at least one special character. 	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted (CVE-2012-0002).
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way the Remote Desktop Protocol service processes packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the target service to stop responding (CVE-2012-0152).
This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.
Note:
NLA or network layer authentication is a layer of security on top of RDP. If NLA is enabled then the vulnerability can be exploited remotely but will need credentials.
1. The authenticated check will determine presence of this vulnerability irrespective of the NLA setting.
2. The remote check can determine presence of this vulnerability only if NLA is disabled.
We encourage customers to patch irrespective of the NLA status.

Security Fixes: Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation)
in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693)
A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue()
and tcp_prune_ofo_queue()
functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.

Security Fixes: Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation)
in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693)
A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue()
and tcp_prune_ofo_queue()
functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.
