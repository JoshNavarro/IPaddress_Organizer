Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.56.98	2019.Jul.13 	2019.Jul.12 11:24 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
This unauthenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of Dropbear SSH based on the banner disclosed by the remote service.	Customers are advised to upgrade to <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dropbear SSH 2016.74</a> or later versions to remediate these vulnerabilities.

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.196.116	2019.Apr.26 	2019.Jul.12 00:19 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):

Windows NT: 
1. Set the following registry key:

Name: RestrictAnonymous
Type: REG_DWORD Value: 1
2. Restart your computer.
Windows 2000:
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure "Additional restrictions of anonymous connections" is set to
"No access without explicit anonymous permissions". 
4. Restart your computer.
Windows XP/2003: 
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure the following two policies are enabled:
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares
4. Disable Network Access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users.
5. Restart your computer.
The above settings have no impact on domain controllers. If this vulnerability was discovered on a domain controller, please note that some of the recommended settings may not have any effect. Read the Microsoft article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257988/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Description of Dcpromo Permissions Choices</a> for more information regarding Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access.

Samba: 
Make the following settings in smb.conf:
•	set "security" to "user" or "domain" or "server" as per your requirements.
•	set "map_to_guest" to "Never"
SECURITY = USER
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. With user-level security a client must first "log=on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
SECURITY = SERVER
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to security = user, but note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file to check users against. See the documentation file in the docs/ directory ENCRYPTION.txt for details on how to set this up.
SECURITY = DOMAIN
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to true. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
•	Also add "restrict anonymous = 2" to the "[global]" configuration section.
Note:Setting this parameter in Samba versions prior to 4 may impact Samba's ability to service Windows 9x clients, act as a Domain Controller or serve as the Master Browser.
