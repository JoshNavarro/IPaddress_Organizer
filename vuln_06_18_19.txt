SSH User Login Bruteforced 
2240 	22 	172.21.56.98	2019.Jun.17 	2019.Jun.15 04:52 	S1 (Urgent) 	One or more valid SSH user logins have been found through bruteforcing. 
An account on a router, firewall, or other network device has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0508)
A Unix account has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0502)
Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		172.25.195.100	2019.Jun.15 	2019.Jun.15 06:50 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Apache Chunked-Encoding Memory Corruption Vulnerability 
2240 	9443 	171.68.165.233	2019.Jun.14 	2019.Jun.13 13:16 	S2 (High) 	Apache is a freely available Web server for Unix and Linux variants, as well as Microsoft operating systems. Various products, such as StrongHold, Oracle 9iAS and IBM Websphere, use or bundle Apache.
The HTTP protocol specifies a method of data coding called 'Chunked Encoding', designed to facilitate fragmentation of HTTP requests in transit. A vulnerability has been discovered in the Apache implementation of 'Chunked Encoding'. When processing requests coded with the 'Chunked Encoding' mechanism, Apache fails to properly calculate required buffer sizes. This is due to improper (signed) interpretation of an unsigned integer value.
On Windows and Netware platforms, Apache uses threads within a single server process to handle concurrent connections. Causing the server process to crash on these platforms may result in a denial of service.
The link <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/info/security_bulletin_20020617.txt" rel="nofollow">
http://httpd.apache.org/info/security_bulletin_20020617.txt</a> provides additional information on this vulnerability for Apache running on Windows.	This vulnerability has been fixed in Apache 1.3.26 and Apache 2.0.37. Please upgrade to <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the latest version</a>.
An <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/httpservers/support.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">efix (via APAR PQ62369)</a> is available for IHS from the IBM HTTP Server Downloads webpage.
A complete list of vendor status and fixes can be found in <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-17.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CERT advisory CA-2002-17</a>
To manually verify this vulnerability, one may telnet to the host/port that the HTTP service is running on, and issue the following request directly:
----[snip]----
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: iopjfds
Transfer-Encoding: Chunked
AAAAAAAA
----[/snip]----
A vulnerable webserver should respond by immediately closing the connection, while a patched webserver should respond with a valid HTTP response code; it may be necessary to try large integers other than AAAAAAAA (e.g. FFFFFFFF or 80000000).
In order to eliminate erroneous behavior from intervening networking equipment, it is important to run the manual verification locally on the target host in question.

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.252.232	2019.May.31 	2019.May.31 01:03 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		10.29.254.16	2019.May.31 	2019.May.31 02:18 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
2240 		10.29.254.42	2019.May.31 	2019.May.31 00:42 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74

2240 	22 	10.29.254.5	2019.May.31 	2019.May.31 00:42 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74

Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart parser Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (S2-045) 
2240 	443 	172.21.196.113	2019.Apr.26 	2019.Jun.15 01:40 	S1 (Urgent) 	Apache Struts is a framework for building web applications. A vulnerability exists due to improper handling of requests with a malicious Content-Type value. If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user.
Affected software:
Apache Struts 2.3.5 to 2.3.31
Apache Struts 2.5 to 2.5.10
QID Detection Logic (Unauthenticated):
The QID has two type of signatures. In the first type the scanner send a custom Content-Type header to check for command execution to the .action, .go,.do and other common files. In the second type the scanner asks the target to perform an arithmetic operation via the Content-Type header to check for command execution. Since this is an active check the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration for the check to work.
Please note:
1) If there is an authentication scheme configured for the server, then VM scanner will not be able to detect this QID. In such cases we recommend using the WAS QID 150173 as WAS has support for authentication as well as in-dept crawling. Please refer to the Qualys Apache Struts blog:
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2017/03/14/apache-struts-cve-2017-5638-vulnerability-and-the-qualys-solution</a>
2) The requests sent by the scanner should be able to invoke the vulnerable struts configuration. If the vulnerable behavior is triggered in a nested directory which the scanner cannot find then this QID will not be posted.
QID detection logic (Authenticated):
Detection looks for "struts core" jar files in deployed web applications directories and lib folder of Tomcat server. Once it successfully finds the jar file, version information is extracted from that jar files and compared.
Please note: Our detection does not support if the applications are deployed with server configuration unpackWARs=false.	The vendor has released advisories and updates to fix these vulnerabilities. Refer to the following link for further details:

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.196.83	2019.Apr.26 	2019.Jun.15 03:14 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

Samba: 
Make the following settings in smb.conf:
•	set "security" to "user" or "domain" or "server" as per your requirements.
•	set "map_to_guest" to "Never"
SECURITY = USER
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. With user-level security a client must first "log=on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
SECURITY = SERVER
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to security = user, but note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file to check users against. See the documentation file in the docs/ directory ENCRYPTION.txt for details on how to set this up.
SECURITY = DOMAIN
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to true. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
•	Also add "restrict anonymous = 2" to the "[global]" configuration section.
Note:Setting this parameter in Samba versions prior to 4 may impact Samba's ability to service Windows 9x clients, act as a Domain Controller or serve as the Master Browser.

Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters.
	Contain both upper and lower case letters.
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9).
	Contain at least one special character.	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		172.25.195.134	2019.Feb.16 	2019.Jun.15 07:12 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)
