SSH User Login Bruteforced 
2240 	22 	10.29.194.241	2019.Aug.28 	2019.Aug.27 18:48 	S1 (Urgent) 	One or more valid SSH user logins have been found through bruteforcing. 
An account on a router, firewall, or other network device has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0508)
A Unix account has a default, null, blank, or missing password.(CVE-1999-0502)
Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20 allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by entering an unspecified password during a (1) SSH or (2) TELNET session.(CVE-2015-7755)
Affected Versions
This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.	Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.<P>
If the host is running Juniper ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20, there are updates available from Juniper for <A HREF="https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713" TARGET="_blank">CVE-2015-7755</A>. <P>
Workaround:<BR>
Restricting management access to only trusted management networks and hosts will help mitigate this issue. The attack can only be executed from a location where a legitimate management login would be permitted.
NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters.
	Contain both upper and lower case letters.
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9).
	Contain at least one special character.	rcanda@cisco.com

SSH Protocol Version 1 Supported 
2240 	22 	10.29.208.134	2019.Aug.28 	2019.Aug.27 17:59 	S2 (High) 	SSH1 protocol was deprecated due to multiple vulnerabilities and design flaws.
Among multiple vulnerabilities that exist in SSH protocol Version 1 are:
a CRC32 compensation attack detector vulnerability (buffer overflow)
an unauthorized session key recovery problem
Multiple vendors' implementations are vulnerable due to the fact that these are protocol design errors. Version 2 of the SSH protocol fixed these errors.

CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		10.22.169.84	2019.Aug.23 	2019.Aug.22 22:38 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	10.29.209.250	2019.Aug.23 	2019.Aug.23 02:37 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident. Dropbear SSH is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to gain sensitive information.
Affected Versions:
Dropbear SSH prior to 2016.74
QID Detection Logic (Authenticated):
This authenticated detection matches vulnerable versions of the Dropbear SSH client by running the "dropbear -V" command.

VMware ESXi 5.5 Patch Release ESXi550-201709101-SG, ESXi550-201709102-SG Missing (KB 2150882)(Spectre) 
1367 		10.22.169.31	2019.Aug.23 	2019.Aug.22 19:39 	S2 (High) 	VMware ESXi is an enterprise level computer virtualization product. 
A vulnerability was reported in VMware ESXi. The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an authenticated VNC session to cause a stack overflow via a specific set of VNC packets. Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session.
CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated CPU execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts. (Speculative execution is an automatic and inherent CPU performance optimization used in all modern processors.) (CVE-2017-5715)
QID Detection Logic(Unauthenticated):
This QID checks for vulnerable versions of VMware ESXi 5.5	To resolve this issue, upgrade to VMware ESXi Build 6480267or the latest VMware ESXi build.

Microsoft SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (MS09-001) 
1367 		10.22.173.186	2019.Jul.30 	2019.Aug.27 06:31 	S1 (Urgent) 	The Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol is a network file sharing protocol used to provide shared access to files, printers, serial ports, and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. It is a client-server implementation and consists of a set of data packets, each containing a request sent by the client or a response sent by the server.
The following remote code execution and denial of service vulnerabilities have been identified in Microsoft SMB protocol which occur when processing specially crafted SMB packets.
1) A vulnerability exists in the way SMB allocates space for a transaction structure and later tries to clear more memory than it should when a TRANS request is processed, allowing an attacker to take control of the system. (CVE-2008-4834)
2) A flaw exists in the way SMB allocates and clears a data structure relating to the OPEN2 command. SMB protocol software insufficiently validates the buffer size before writing to it, allowing attackers to take complete control of the system and allowing remote execution of code. (CVE-2008-4835)
3) A denial of service vulnerability exists due to the way "srv.sys" handles malformed SMB WRITE_ANDX packets sent to an interface that uses a Named Pipe as endpoint. This flaw allows remote attackers to send a specially-crafted network message to a computer running the Server service causing it to stop responding. (CVE-2008-4114)
Attempts to exploit any of the above listed vulnerabilities does not require authentication.
Microsoft has rated the issues as critical for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, and moderate for Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.
Windows XP Embedded Systems:- For additional information regarding security updates for embedded systems, refer to the following MSDN blog(s):
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/embedded/archive/2009/03/02/february-security-updates-are-now-avaiable.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">February Security Updates are Now Available</a> (KB958687)

TCP ports 139 and 445 should be blocked at the firewall to protect systems behind the firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. 
Impact of workaround: Blocking the ports can cause several windows services or applications using those ports to stop functioning.

NOTE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU’RE RUNNING JUNOS, IT IS MERELY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE RUNNING JUNOS.
Change the user passwords so that they are difficult to guess.
Eg.. Strong passwords should (at a minimum) meet the following requirements:
	Contain at least eight alphanumeric characters.
	Contain both upper and lower case letters.
	Contain at least one number (for example, 0-9).
	Contain at least one special character.	rcanda@cisco.com 	tleese@cisco.com

Dropbear SSH Multiple Security Vulnerabilities 
2240 	22 	172.21.196.116	2019.Apr.26 	2019.Aug.23 01:23 	S1 (Urgent) 	Dropbear is a software package that provides a Secure Shell-compatible server and client. It is designed as a replacement for standard OpenSSH for environments with low memory and processor resources, such as embedded systems.
Dropbear SSH contains the following vulnerabilites:
CVE-2016-7406: Format string vulnerability in Dropbear SSH allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) host argument.
CVE-2016-7407: The dropbearconvert command in Dropbear SSH allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted OpenSSH key file.
CVE-2016-7408: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where dbclient is used in scripts. Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of an application using the affected library. 
CVE-2016-7409: The dbclient and server in Dropbear SSH before 2016.74, when compiled with DEBUG_TRACE, allows local users to read process memory via the -v argument, related to a failed remote ident.

Null Session/Password NetBIOS Access 
2240 		172.21.196.141	2019.Apr.26 	2019.Aug.22 20:50 	S1 (Urgent) 	Unauthorized users can connect to this NetBIOS service without a password.	Null NetBIOS sessions can be disabled using the following methods:
Windows NT: 
1. Set the following registry key: 
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
Name: RestrictAnonymous
Type: REG_DWORD Value: 1
2. Restart your computer.
Windows 2000:
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure "Additional restrictions of anonymous connections" is set to
"No access without explicit anonymous permissions". 
4. Restart your computer.
Windows XP/2003: 
1. Start "Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Policy".
2. Open "Local Policies-->Security Options".
3. Make sure the following two policies are enabled:
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts
•	Network Access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares
4. Disable Network Access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users.
5. Restart your computer.
The above settings have no impact on domain controllers. If this vulnerability was discovered on a domain controller, please note that some of the recommended settings may not have any effect. Read the Microsoft article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257988/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Description of Dcpromo Permissions Choices</a> for more information regarding Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access.

Samba: 
Make the following settings in smb.conf:
•	set "security" to "user" or "domain" or "server" as per your requirements.
•	set "map_to_guest" to "Never"
SECURITY = USER
This is the default security setting in Samba 2.2. With user-level security a client must first "log=on" with a valid username and password (which can be mapped using the username map parameter). Encrypted passwords can also be used in this security mode. Parameters such as user and guest only if set are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
SECURITY = SERVER
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box. If this fails it will revert to security = user, but note that if encrypted passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file to check users against. See the documentation file in the docs/ directory ENCRYPTION.txt for details on how to set this up.
SECURITY = DOMAIN
This mode will only work correctly if smbpasswd(8) has been used to add this machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the encrypted passwords parameter to be set to true. In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.
•	Also add "restrict anonymous = 2" to the "[global]" configuration section.
Note:Setting this parameter in Samba versions prior to 4 may impact Samba's ability to service Windows 9x clients, act as a Domain Controller or serve as the Master Browser.
